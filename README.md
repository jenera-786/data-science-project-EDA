This project is focused on performing a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing match-related information. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights, trends, and patterns that can help in understanding the dynamics of matches, team performances, and player statistics.

The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to document the thought process, code, and visualizations in a single environment. The project is built using the following key libraries:

Pandas: for efficient data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.

NumPy: for numerical operations and handling large arrays.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: for creating insightful and visually appealing plots such as bar charts, heatmaps, pie charts, histograms, and line graphs.

Key Steps in the EDA:
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, and dealing with inconsistencies.

Descriptive Statistics: Understanding the distribution of data using mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and more.

Correlation Matrix: Understanding how numerical variables are related.

Visualizations: Using Seaborn and Matplotlib to turn raw data into easy-to-understand visuals.

 Objectives:
Identify key players and top-performing teams.

Understand the factors that influence match outcomes.

Detect any anomalies or interesting patterns in the match data.
